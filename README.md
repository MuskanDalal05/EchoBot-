# EchoBot-
EchoBot is a simple yet powerful Java-based text-to-speech (TTS) application that gives your computer a voice. Built using Java and Windows PowerShell’s System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer, it allows users to type any text and instantly hear it spoken aloud.
Key Features:
🔹 Interactive console-based interface
🔹 Converts user input text into natural-sounding speech
🔹 Supports continuous input until the user types exit
🔹 Uses Windows’ built-in text-to-speech engine (no external libraries required)
🔹 Lightweight, fast, and easy to run

How It Works:

User enters text in the console.

EchoBot passes the text to Windows PowerShell.

The System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer speaks the text aloud.

The loop continues until the user types exit.

Use Cases:
🎓 Learning project to understand Java + OS integration
🖥️ Assistive tool for text reading
🎤 Fun utility for voice announcements or reminders
🚀 Base project for building advanced speech-enabled apps
